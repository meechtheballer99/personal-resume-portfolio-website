  <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
  <p>
    I am an IT enthusiast seeking to help develop the
    <strong>computer science</strong> field and
    <strong>LOVE</strong> programming. It is for this reason I maintain a highly
    sophsiticated, up-to-date Home Research Lab. I started in technology at a
    young age through my natural draw and <em>love</em> for computers and
    computer network technology and how the internet works. My father and mother
    constantly exposed to me the latest technology of the time, and I became the
    at-home onsite computer technician. That is why I modded computer games like
    the infamous building block game <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Halo</em> when I
    was 11 years old in junior high, and eventually studied over two summers to
    obtain the Cisco Certified Network Associate certification (CCNA) as a
    junior in high school, thanks in great part to my encouraging older brother
    who is a Network Engineer. If there were only a few defining characteristics
    you will remember of me, it is that I am a <strong>deep thinker</strong>,
    and very <strong>studious</strong> and <strong>observant</strong> at all
    times. I live and breathe <strong>scientific thinking</strong>, from
    <em>mathematics</em>, <em>economics</em>, <em>physics</em>,
    <em>genetics</em>, <strong>computer science</strong> ‚Äî down to the very
    <strong>psychology</strong> of how we think, learn, and communicate in this
    <em>intertwined, complex system</em> governed by the
    <strong>Laws of Creation</strong>, which is the frontier of
    <strong>Cybernetics</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>. I
    believe that, in essence, there is truly <em>nothing artificial</em> about
    Artificial Intelligence at all. By the very sophisticated nature of the
    universe, there is <strong>no such thing</strong> as intelligence that is
    artificial! There is only <strong><em>real</em> intelligence</strong>. And
    that intelligence is built into the very fabric of the Universe. Only we
    must continue to <strong><em>discover</em></strong> it, and
    <strong><em>harness</em></strong> it, as God has planned for us as stewarts
    over His Creation.

    </li>
    <li>

      and troubleshooting activities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Created an entire full-fledged framework - including development of Python
      modules and creation of a Python Virtual Enviroment to host my Python
      framework - for a suite of vision tools that interact with APIs from our
      vision application backened, including GCP storage, PVC storage, and
      MongoDB-stored image metadata. I designed a modular approach which wrapped
      API calls into the context of our environment, giving flexibility to use
      modules directly, or to use the framework to create other scripts that
      adhear to our environment. This enabled rapid development for any
      vision-related data tied to our application for scripting out lightweight
      applications on the fly, benefiting technical leads and our customers
      alike.
    </li>
    <li>
      Created an entire full-fleged modular python program - including
      development of Python modules and creation of a Python Virtual Enviroment
      to host my Python framework - to diagnose, troubleshoot, diagram, document
      (including version control), and setup for our vision system across all of
      Ford globally, which includes hundreds of deployments, to make the
      deployment of our application scalable and manageable, taking
      troubleshoot, setup, and documentation time from hours and days to mere
      seconds. The modularity of my program is at a complex systems-level
      thinking, and enables the suite of tools to be used as stand alone and as
      a conglomerate tool. Components involved include: and API that interacts
      with MongoDB to fetch metadata, GCP/PVC Storage, and MQTT data from
      various sources, all of which were cross compiled and analyzed into useful
      setup, diagnostic, and diagrammed (yes, I created a graph module using
      Pyvis library) results. There is also a web-scraping component using the
      Selenium Web Driver python library, which I used to create an entire
      framework for my team to use to build web scrapers within a specific web
      application in the Ford environment, reducing the manual effort needed to
      download and import results into our vision systems diagnostic and setup
      program.

      (AI/C++): Find probabilities from a Markov Chain data model; for CIS 479
      SUMMER II With Dr. Shengquan Wang. Further tested my original program from
      my first attempt, but with different test cases for computing MLE
      transition probabilities for a 3-state Markov chain with Laplace
      smoothing; proving the reliability, accuracy, and modularity of my program
      from the first attempt.
